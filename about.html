            		<p class="about">Based on my experience as a designer as well as my interaction with day to day items throughout
            		my life, I have learned that <em> users ignore designs that ignore the user. </em> Today, practicing user-centered design
            		has become the focal point of several industries, and I am excited to be a part of this movement. I had always had an interest
            		in front-end development, specifically HTML and CSS, and soon learned the strength of its application in the realm
            		of user interface design. I was introduced to Cognitive Science at <a href="http://ucsd.edu/" class="ucsd"> UC San Diego</a>, specializing in 
            		Human Computer Interaction and am a proud graduate of the department three years later. Since then I have continued to polish my 
            		skills through online courses centered around design and programming. I also enjoy working with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and have completed several projects
            		editing live traces with the software as well as used the tools for prototyping and wire-framing purposes (along with 
            		other tools such as Axure and GoMockingbird). Currently, I am pursuing my masters
            		in Information Science at the <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/" class="ucsd">University of Michigan's School of Information</a>. 
            		Not only will I continue my study of Human Computer Interaction, but I hope to learn more about and apply my knowledge of design to the 
            		area of Information Analysis and Retrieval.</p>
            	
            		<!--</p>I am eternally grateful to have been exposed to opportunities and experts 
            		in the field during my undergraduate years and after. From my work as a research assistant in two neuroscience labs, to my internship with a web development
            		company <a href="http://webdsc.com/" class="ucsd">(WebDSC)</a>, I have been constantly learning. My membership at<a href="http://www.meetup.com/sandchi/" class="ucsd">San Diego's Computer Human Interaction Group (SandCHI) </a>
            		has been a great way to learn about trends in the field as well as network with individuals who are experience and established
            		in the area of HCI. A recent graduate, I am currently working as a research assistant at <a href="http://kutaslab.ucsd.edu/" class="ucsd"> Kutas Labs </a>, 
            		studying the effects of multi-sensory input on overall auditory perception as well as interning as a UI/UX designer and researcher at
            		the <a href="http://www.balboapark.org/bpoc" class="ucsd"> Balboa Park Online Collaborative (BPOC)</a>.  </p>-->
            		
            		<p class="about">Some of my passions outside of HCI include eating, travelling, and singing. I am a huge fan of a cappella, and 
            		have participated in several competitions and showcases throughout college! I also love yoga and working out, however those
            		activities tend to become compensated by my interest in food (Click for <a href="http://www.abigmissedsteak.wordpress.com/" class="ucsd">Food Blog</a>). Please feel free to view my LinkedIn and Resume, explore my portfolio, and
            		contact me for any questions/thoughts/suggestions! </p>
